# Insurance Charges Forecasting with Linear Regression

## Linear Regression Theory
<div align="justify">
  
It is a statistical model that attempts to illustrate the relationship between independent and dependent variable, with a linear equation, if it is continuous. Line of linear regression is represented by the equation,
<div align="center">y = mx + c</div>
where, y is the dependent variable, x is independent variable, m is slope of the line and c is y-intercept of the line.
  
The slope can be calculated by,
<div align="center">m= Σ(x- x̄)(y- ȳ) / Σ(x- x̄)²</div>
where, x̄ and ȳ are the mean of x and y, respectively.

## Dataset
The dataset has been taken from Kaggle. The main objective of the analysis is to accurately forecast insurance charges. This dataset consists of 1338 rows and 7 columns.<br />

*age*: age of primary beneficiary<br />
*gender*: insurance contractor gender, female, male<br />
*bmi*: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9<br />
*children*: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents<br />
*smoker*: Smoking<br />
